# PageTransmuter
**PageTransmuter** is a command-line tool that transforms HTML files into valid C/C++ macros, allowing them to be embedded directly into small HTTP servers without requiring a filesystem.

Especially useful for **embedded systems** (Arduino, ESP32...) and minimal servers.

## Why PageTransmuter?
When building small HTTP servers in C or C++, it is common to end up manually escaping HTML strings before sending them to the client.  
This approach is error-prone, hard to maintain, and does not scale well.

**PageTransmuter solves this problem by:**

- Converting HTML files into C/C++ macros
- Escaping all problematic characters automatically
- Generating output that can be directly included in source code
- Optionally embedding HTTP response headers into the macro

This makes embedded or low-level web projects **cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to update**.

## Basic usage
```bash
pagetransmuter -f file.html                 # Output to stdout
pagetransmuter -f file.html -o file.h       # Output to file
```

## Installation
